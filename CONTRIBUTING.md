# Contributing to [Guizhong](https://github.com/yuhuanowo/Guizhong)

Contributions are more than welcome! Contributing to Guizhong means that it is kept in a working condition, which means that less people have to worry about paying for bots just to listen to music with their friends.

Even if you can't contribute directly to the codebase, you can open an issue on GitHub to report bugs or request new features.

## Contributing Through Issues

To contribute through issues and feature requests, open a new issue on the GitHub issues page of the main Guizhong repository ([yuhuanowo/Guizhong](https://github.com/yuhuanowo/Guizhong)). Make your issue as descriptive as possible, including things like steps to reproduce for bug reports, and how you would like a feature to be implemented for feature requests.

Once you have submitted your issue, someone will review it and potentially add your features, or fix your bugs. Once that's happened, you've officially contributed to Guizhong! :D

## Contributing to the Codebase

If you want to contribute directy to the code base, you can do so through a pull request.

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your code, and test it (We want all code on the main repo to be working)
3. Format all of your code with prettier using `npm run format`
4. Ensure that none of the documentation is incorrect after your changes
5. Create a pull request to merge it back into the main repository!

We do ask that once you fork Guizhong with the intention of merging back in, that your fork is kept up to date with the main repository. GitHub makes this really easy to do, with a little tracker that shows how many commits ahead and behind your fork is with options to sync the two.

## Developing Locally

Developing Guizhong locally is actually really simple, just clone the repository, rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml`, fill in the configuration details, then run `npm run test` to start up the bot.

### Thanks for contributing to Guizhong <3
