<h2>About Guizhong</h2>
Melody was primarily developed because the best music bots shut down, and most alternatives had core features locked behind a paywall. Melody started as a bot that was just used in a server with some friends, and then became a project that I released publicly for anyone to use and maintain.

<h2>Features</h2>
Melody is a feature-rich Discord music bot. It offers a clean look, easy to use commands, and active development. Check out the list below for a full list of features:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Multi-server support</li>
<li>Song lyrics integration</li>
<li>Volume controller</li>
<li>Full player control with pausing, seeking, and volume control</li>
<li>Queue support with skipping, returning to the previous song, viewing queued songs, queue shuffling, queue clearing, adding songs to the end of the queue, or the next position in the queue</li>
<li>Listening statistics that allow you to see how many songs you've listened to, how many songs you've skipped, and how many times you've shuffled the queue</li>
<li>An easy to reference help menu</li>
<li>Saving songs right to your direct messages for you to refer back to later</li>
<li>10+ effects to spice up your music</li>
<li>Search autocomplete</li>
<li>Support for YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, Vimeo and Reverbnation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
For a detailed installation guide, check out our <a href="https://github.com/NerdyTechy/Melody/wiki/Installation">Installation wiki page</a>.

## Analytics

By default, Melody tracks basic anonymous analytics when you start up the bot. To disable this, set the `enableAnalytics` option in the configuration file to **false**. To learn more about the analytics Melody sends, <a href="https://github.com/NerdyTechy/Melody/wiki/Analytics">click here</a>.

## Genius

Melody utilises Genius' API to find lyrics for songs. A Genius API key isn't required to use the bot, but will make the lyrics features far more reliable. Obtaining one is free, and can be done so <a href="https://genius.com/api-clients">here</a>.

## Hosting

Want to host this bot online? Any hosting company that provides Discord bot hosting will work, but I highly recommend <a href="https://techy.lol/revivenode">Revivenode</a> (Affiliate Link).
